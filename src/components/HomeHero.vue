    <h1>Dear Hiring Manager,</h1>
    <p>
      I’m reaching out to express my extremely professional level of excitement about the Front End
      Developer position. I stalked the posting on your website in a totally non-creepy way, and
      couldn’t help but notice that my skills and experience line up almost too perfectly with what
      you're looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a creative front-end developer ninja with a legendary amount of experience, whipping up
      visually stunning and user-friendly interfaces and slaying projects left and right like there
      is no tomorrow. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Please. I devour those before my morning coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not just a developer. Not just a designer. I’m the full package: a well-oiled machine
      (possibly over-lubricated). Skilled, detail-obsessed, a team player, and cheap—because who
      says you can’t have it all? Consider me your go-to for making the impossible look easy (and
      possibly even fun).
    </p>
    <p>You’d be lucky to have me on your team!</p>
    <p>
      Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire
      me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please
      hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me.
      Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me. Please hire me.
    </p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br />Patrick John Pacana</p>
